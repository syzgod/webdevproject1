## My process

### Built with

HTML + CSS
Flexbox

### What I learned

First lesson is online bootcamps and Youtube won't teach you writing codes. You need to actively practice coding and do projects, try solutions and read documentations(MDN...).

Flexbox is an amazing thing in CSS but can be a mess with wrong HTML nesting. That was my second biggest lesson that the HTML must be right in order to use Flex properly.
Second huge learning was the flexbox itself. I will be honest, I struggled the most with getting the flex right. For some reason after watching many guides still couldn't understand it properly unless I tried myself and also asked for help. After getting it(hopefully) of course it is easy but definitely it is something which needs to be practiced a lot.

Different pictures to replace one with another depending on a device(desktop+mobile) was also a nice learning for me.

Media query is an amazing tool loving it, very useful these day when tablets and mobiles are pretty much mainstream.

Something very new for me: "mix-blend-mode: multiply;" - probably I'm not alone.

Also learning that Flexbox itself add a basic margin so resetting all the margins before we use flexbox can be very useful.


### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
